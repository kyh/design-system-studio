### Continuous Integration

> Continuous integration is a practice that encourages developers to integrate their code into a master branch of a shared repository early and often. Instead of building out features in isolation and integrating them at the end of a development cycle, code is integrated with the shared repository by each developer multiple times throughout the day.

The project is configured to do the following:

- Build the component library
- Run all unit tests in the component library package
- Build and test SSR for the demo app
- Run visual tests using [Chromatic](http://chromaticqa.com)

The Chromatic task reads the `CHROMATIC_APP_CODE` [environment variable](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/env-vars/#using-bash_env-to-set-environment-variables), which must be configured in your CircleCI dashboard.
