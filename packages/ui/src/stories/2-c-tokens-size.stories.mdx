# Size Tokens

> Intended for use with layout-related CSS properties such as width and height. A size scale can be defined as either a plain object or an array, but by convention an array is preferred. This is an intentional constraint that makes it difficult to add _one-off_ or _in-between_ sizes that could lead to unwanted and rippling affects to layout.
